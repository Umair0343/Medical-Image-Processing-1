# Medical Image Processing Project
A comprehensive image processing project focused on enhancing and analyzing medical images. The implementation included various techniques to improve image quality and visibility for medical analysis.
# Key Features:

1. Image Enhancement

Implemented Histogram Equalization for optimal contrast enhancement
Achieved improved clarity and sharpness in medical imagery


2. Noise Reduction

Applied Gaussian filtering with optimized parameters
Kernel size: 5x5
Sigma value: 3
Resulted in cleaner, more precise medical images


3. Image Inversion

Implemented negative image transformation (255 - pixel value)
Enhanced visibility of previously obscured features and edges


4. Advanced Filtering

Integrated Box filtering technique for additional image refinement



5. Dataset

Processed and analyzed a dataset of 10 diverse medical images
Applied consistent processing techniques across the entire dataset
