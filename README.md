# Medical-Image-Processing-1
This project involves medical images processing. Here are the tasks performed on 10 different medical images:

1. Data Preparation:
The provided folder contained 10 medical images.

2. Image Enhancement:
I used the following techniques for image enhancement. After I used the Histogram Equalization
technique and which I think was the best technique in this case for enhancement the above
image looked clear and sharp.

3. Noise reduction
For this particular task noise reduction I used Gaussian filter and the noise was reduced. I used
kernel size=(5,5) and sigma value= 3

4. Negative images
This task was quite simple. I just had to use the negative images formula by inverting the image
pixel value ( 255 - image). The images looked pretty good in this case because some pixels
and edges which were not clear before made a clear appearance.

5. Applying the Box filtering technique
